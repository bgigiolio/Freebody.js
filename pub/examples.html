        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Freebody.js currently supports 2 types of diagrams:
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Inclined Planes
        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="info" id="d2">
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Flat Planes
        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="info" id="d3">
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Both diagrams share much of the same functionality excluding those specific to the inclined plnae (Slope and plane highlighting).
            Obviously, there is more functionality than just displaying, so lets dive into some examples.
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Each diagram comes with built-in input generators for key styles. In the inclined plane these include the ability to set the slope and the height.
            In the flat plane, the only built-in input is for width of the diagram. Below is an example for the inclined plane.
        </h3>
        <br/>
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Feel free to mess around with the values. As a warning, extreme slopes and heights may make the model look odd!
        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="info" id="d4">
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            There is also the ability to add custom height and width labels. These fall into 2 categories:
            <ul>
                <li>Number labels: If the height is set using a number label, the width will be automatically calculated.
                    You are also able to add units which will globally apply to the width too
                </li>
                <li>
                    Text labels: If the height/width are set using a non-number, you can set custom values like "6x".
                    If only the height is set, the width will be set using the formula width = height / tan(angle)
                </li>
            </ul>
            Below is an example of text labels on an inclined plane:
        </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="info" id="d5">
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            Finally, to see values of forces applied to the object, we can use the popup. To activate the popup, click on either the plane or the box
        </h3>
        <h3 class="bodyText">
            (Try hovering over one of the forces in the popup after you select the box!)
        </h3>
    </div>
